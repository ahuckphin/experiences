                        Experimented with different speech dictation services. Over 1 year, I have gained an insight into the different limitations and dictation quality of different websites which offers speech dictation services. Some more purpose built than others. I also had an opportunity to learn the feasibility of splicing up the generated text from speech dictation software to match the PowerPoint slides they are associated with. Concluded on if this rather unconvential approach to note taking was effective or not.

                    <p>Despite no prior knowledge or experience of leading a club or society, let alone reviving an inactive club, I persevered through and learnt the processes and systems. From which, I lead a committee which organised events throughout the year of 2019. Events included a series of workshops organised in collobration with a couple of other clubs and socities and meet and greet sessions to raise funds for the club and to interact with fellow university students through playing games.</p>

                    <p>My highlight during my time in Go Green Club would be in mid-2020 where I successfully initated  an idea contributed by a fellow club member to recognise the efforts of Covid-19 frontliners. The project grew until it was recognised by universtiy's management who subsequently took over the project and took it to then next level. Click here to see final product of this project.</p>

                    <p>I independently ran a virtual programming workshop where I shared with participants the process to develop a graphical user interface rock paper scissors game with the Java programming language. This experience was eye opening and allowed me to gain an insight into the work that lecturers do to educate individuals.  </p>

                    <p>One other project I am proud of is utilizing university's existing digital resources to establish a university's clubs and socities information hub. Prior to establishig a Microsoft SharePoint website, there was no 1 location where students can launch to learn more about different clubs and socities, get in contact with the respective clubs and socities president to get more information and register for clubs and socities.</p>

				  <p>One highlight will be car photography from Q4 2018 to Q1 2020. During this period of time, I actively travelled to malls and shoppng centres on a frequent basis seeking out roadshows. If roadshows were present, I would have photographed the car(s) available in detail for both the exterior and interior if I hadn't photographed that particular model before. No prior permission or scheduling was executed so some verbal explainiation had to communicated to the sales people attending the roadshow from time to time. After capturing the photographs, the photo was first edited to blur the faces of passing members of the public before being compiled in a video editing software to make a photo slideshow video. Towards the end of this stig, I experimented with alternate format of videos which evolved on from the photo slideshow concept. One such alternate format envolved the inclusion of specifcations or captions relavant to photo's content in text form underneath a photo in the video. Second alternate format, envolved taking photos of 2 different cars and providing visual comparison by stiching together, for example, 2 pictures of the front of a car, 1 from 1 car and another 1 from a different car. The photographs in full quality are also uploaded to Wikimedia Commons where they are explicitly marked with a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 license allowing for sharing and reuse of my work with attribution.

                     <p>My media production is mostly concentrated on video production with videos being publically published onto video sharing site, YouTube. As of 2021, I now publish videos onto different YouTube channels based on the video's category. </p>
